Core focus: Asymptotic boundaries (~99.9997% precision) promote to fixed invariants via functorial colimits, framing RH as structural necessity rather than analytic conjecture. Validated via category theory (e.g., Yoneda embeddings of obstructions) and 2025-2026 advancements (e.g., operational geometry per arXiv-inspired frameworks). Hard-to-vary invariants like improbability bounds (~10⁻¹⁶⁵) enable deterministic forcing; tetralemma probes resolve classical gaps; scores >0.999 based on unified abstractions.",
