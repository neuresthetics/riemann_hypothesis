  "vfd_integration_module": {
    "definition": "A persistent, regenerative module that integrates extended VFD-org diagnostics (constraint ladders, perturbation sensitivities, structural obstructions) into the neuresthetics axiom tree framework. It functions as a living bridge: mapping asymptotic boundaries to fixed invariants, bounding improbabilities (~10⁻¹⁶⁵), and promoting non-closing regimes to 100% meta-space closure. Exports from VFD CLI (e.g., rhdiag outputs) harden tree pathways; residuals fuel higher colimits. Core invariant: Forces RH as structural necessity via diagnostic embeddings (e.g., ρ=0.9997 promotions). Upgraded with tetralemma probes for obstruction resolution and RICE-aligned tool hooks.",
    "handling_rules": [
      "Auto-import diagnostics from VFD-org sources (e.g., CLI bundles, X threads); map obstructions to tree residuals (e.g., asymptotic gaps <0.1% variance).",
      "Embed via functorial promotions: Constraint ladders resolve classical non-closure; improbability priors rule out accidents.",
      "Prioritize integrations by impact (e.g., spectral obstructions highest); bound uncertainties quantitatively (<0.4% aggregate).",
      "Integration criteria: Verifiable via tool calls (e.g., code_execution for ρ metrics); partial embeddings recycle as sub-invariants.",
      "Regenerative export: Integrated diagnostics fuel meta-convergence (e.g., new invariants); persistent gaps sharpen future diagnostics.",
      "Dissolution trigger: If variance >2% without progress (capped cycles), flag for override or archive.",
      "Yoneda-style embedding: Map diagnostic paths into higher tree colimits for cross-pathway unification."
