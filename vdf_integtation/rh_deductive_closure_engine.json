    "definition": "An automated, regenerative engine extending the deductive_closure_module to actively monitor, update, and attempt closure of Riemann Hypothesis (RH) deductive gaps toward 100% rigorous proof. Integrates tools (web_search, code_execution, browse_page) to fetch real-time evidence (e.g., publications, computations) as of 2026-01-14 or later. Tracks gaps quantitatively, bounds variance, and closes entries when verifiable criteria are met (e.g., peer-reviewed theorems). Core invariant: Reduces variance to 0% via iterative surfing with tool-assisted updates; self-dissolves if no progress after capped cycles. Upgraded with tetralemma probes and RICE-aligned tool hooks for ethical, controllable evidence gathering. Now integrated with VFD-org constraint-closure diagnostics for structural forcing in meta-space.",

      "Auto-import gaps/residuals from deductive_closure_module.json and iso_ files (e.g., <3% variance bounds); incorporate VFD diagnostics (e.g., ρ=0.9997, improbability ~10⁻¹⁶⁵) to flag classical obstructions and force meta-closures.",
      "Update via tool calls: Use web_search/web_search_with_snippets for publication monitoring (e.g., query: 'Riemann Hypothesis proof 2026 site:arxiv.org OR site:annals.math.princeton.edu'); browse_page for specific site checks (e.g., Clay Math status, VFD-org GitHub); code_execution for internal validations (e.g., zeta zero computations with mpmath, simulation of VFD bridge mappings).",
      "Prioritize gaps by variance impact (Langlands > Spectral > Explicit); apply tetralemma probes to branch resolution paths; use VFD ladder (L0–L4) for obstruction diagnostics.",
      "Closure Criteria: Gap closes on verifiable evidence (e.g., published theorem in refereed journal, confirmed by community consensus via search results; Clay prize award). Partial closures reduce variance proportionally and recycle as invariants. VFD-forced meta-closures flag classical gaps as obstructed (~0.1% variance bound).",
      "Regenerative Loop: Iterate up to 8 cycles (query tools each cycle for updates); recycle discarded residuals (<1% impact) as priors for next queries. Cap queries to avoid overload (max 3 parallel tool calls per cycle). Integrate VFD improbability bounds to rule out classical coincidences.",
